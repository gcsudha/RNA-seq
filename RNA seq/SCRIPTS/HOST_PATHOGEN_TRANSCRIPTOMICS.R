# OBJECTIVES
# TEST HYPOTHESES
# SCIENCE Ho 1: DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENE PROFILES ARE THE 
  # SAME ACROSS SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC HOSTS
# SCIENCE Ho 2: SYMPTOMATIC HOSTS DO NOT RESPOND TO V.DAHIAE INFECTION 
  # WITH DEG PROFILES
# SCIENCE Ho 3: STRAINS OF V. DAHLIAE DO NOT EXHIBIT DEGS PROFILES 
  # BETWEEN SYMPTOMATIC HOSTS OR BETWEEN SYMPTOMATIC vs. ASYMPTOMATIC HOSTS
# STATISTICAL Ho 1-3: 
  # Observed variation in DEG across treatments represents
  # random variation, not systematic effects of hosts or isolates
  # Variation in the DEG is unrelated to variation in the hosts and isolates
  # and is no greater than expected by chance or sampling error.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS
# INOCULUM PREPARATION FOR ROOT DIP (3.5"pot):
  # INOCULUM FOR 111:
    # 180 plants/3 isolates = 60 plants/isolate * 100 ml/plant (Dung et al. 2010) = 6000 ml = 6 L inoculum
    # 6 L of 10^6 conidia/ml inoculum is needed
    # 6 L/200 ml/flask = 30 flasks 
  # INOCULUM FOR 653:
    # 180 plants/3 isolates = 60 plants/isolate * 100 ml/plant (Dung et al. 2010) = 6000 ml = 6 L inoculum
    # 6 L of 10^6 conidia/ml inoculum is needed
    # 6 L/200 ml/flask = 30 flasks 
    
# TRIAL ONE PLANTED: 5/1/2018
# TRIAL ONE INOCULATED: 5/19/2018
# FIRST HARVEST: POTATO, MINT AND MUSTARD HARVESTED @ 2 DPI: 5/21/2018
# SECOND HARVEST: MUSTARD: 5/29/2018
